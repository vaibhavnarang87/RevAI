# Data Collection
 
Reddit:
	•	Reddit API (PRAW) to extract comments and posts from relevant subreddits (e.g., r/stocks, r/investing).
	•	Search for mentions of the company or its ticker symbol.
WSJ/CNBC:
	•	Paywalled Content: If WSJ or CNBC articles are behind a paywall, use legitimate subscription APIs to access the data. WSJ and CNBC have APIs available for enterprise use.
	•	Scraping Alternatives: For free content, use a web scraper like BeautifulSoup or Selenium (ensure compliance with terms of service).
Other Sources:
	•	Use APIs like:
	◦	NewsAPI for general financial news.
	◦	Twitter API for social media chatter.
	◦	Google Alerts or RSS feeds for specific company news.

# Preprocess the Data
	•	Text Cleaning:
	◦	Remove URLs, special characters, and excessive whitespace.
	◦	Tokenize the text and handle stop words.
	•	Sentiment Analysis Ready:
	◦	Lemmatize/stem words.
	◦	Translate non-English content (if necessary).
	•	Feature Engineering:
	◦	Extract keywords like "forecast," "beat," "miss," "guidance."
	◦	Include metadata such as source, date, or sentiment intensity.

# Fine-Tuning or Context-Specific Instructions:
	•	Fine-tune ChatGPT with data from your niche (earnings calls, forecasts, etc.) to make it more relevant.
	•	If fine-tuning is not possible, use carefully designed prompts with context.
 
# Parallelizing Analysis:
	•	Use ChatGPT to run alongside your ML models:
	◦	While the ML model predicts quantitative performance (hit/miss forecasts), ChatGPT can provide qualitative context, like:
	▪	"Why is the sentiment negative despite a forecast beat?"
	▪	"How might market sentiment adjust to unexpected guidance?"
 
# Automation:
	•	Integrate ChatGPT into your pipeline:
	◦	Use tools like Zapier, Airflow, or custom Python scripts to automate interactions with the OpenAI API.
	Example:
	▪	Post-data collection: Automatically summarize a CNBC article using ChatGPT.
	▪	Pre-inference: Use ChatGPT to refine or validate the feature extraction process.
